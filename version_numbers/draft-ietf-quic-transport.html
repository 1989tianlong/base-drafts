</h1>
<p>QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience, and implements mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport protocol.  Using UDP as the basis of QUIC is intended to address compatibility issues with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC authenticates all of its headers, preventing third parties from changing them.  QUIC encrypts most of its headers, thereby limiting protocol evolution to QUIC endpoints only.  Therefore, middleboxes, in large part, are not required to be updated as new protocol versions are deployed.  This document describes the core QUIC protocol, including the conceptual design, wire format, and mechanisms of the QUIC protocol for connection establishment, stream multiplexing, stream and connection-level flow control, and data reliability.  Accompanying documents describe QUIC&#8217;s loss recovery and congestion control, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience and implements mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport protocol.  Using UDP as the substrate, QUIC seeks to be compatible with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC authenticates all of its headers, preventing middleboxes and other third parties from changing them, and encrypts most of its headers, limiting protocol evolution largely to QUIC endpoints only.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This document describes the core QUIC protocol, including the conceptual design, wire format, and mechanisms of the QUIC protocol for connection establishment, stream multiplexing, stream and connection-level flow control, and data reliability.  Accompanying documents describe QUIC&#8217;s loss detection and congestion control <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This section briefly describes QUIC&#8217;s key mechanisms and benefits.  Key strengths of QUIC include:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Low-latency Version Negotiation</li>
  <li>Low-latency connection establishment</li>
  <li>Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking</li>
  <li>Authenticated and encrypted header and payload</li>

<h2 id="rfc.section.3.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> <a href="#low-latency-version-negotiation" id="low-latency-version-negotiation">Low-Latency Version Negotiation</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">QUIC combines version negotiation with the rest of connection establishment to avoid unnecessary roundtrip delays.  A QUIC client proposes a version to use for the connection, and encodes the rest of the handshake using the proposed version.  If the server does not speak the client-chosen version, it forces version negotiation by sending back a Version Negotiation packet to the client, causing a roundtrip of delay before connection establishment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">This mechanism eliminates roundtrip latency when the client&#8217;s optimistically-chosen version is spoken by the server, and incentivizes servers to not lag behind clients in deployment of newer versions. Additionally, an application may negotiate QUIC versions out-of-band to increase chances of success in the first roundtrip and to obviate the additional roundtrip in the case of version mismatch.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#low-latency-connection-establishment" id="low-latency-connection-establishment">Low-Latency Connection Establishment</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">QUIC relies on a combined crypto and transport handshake for setting up a secure transport connection.  QUIC connections are expected to commonly use 0-RTT handshakes, meaning that for most QUIC connections, data can be sent immediately following the client handshake packet, without waiting for a reply from the server.  QUIC provides a dedicated stream (Stream ID 1) to be used for performing the crypto handshake and QUIC options negotiation.  The format of the QUIC options and parameters used during negotiation are described in this document, but the handshake protocol that runs on Stream ID 1 is described in the accompanying crypto handshake draft <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> <a href="#stream-multiplexing" id="stream-multiplexing">Stream Multiplexing</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">When application messages are transported over TCP, independent application messages can suffer from head-of-line blocking.  When an application multiplexes many streams atop TCP&#8217;s single-bytestream abstraction, a loss of a TCP segment results in blocking of all subsequent segments until a retransmission arrives, irrespective of the application streams that are encapsulated in subsequent segments.  QUIC ensures that lost packets carrying data for an individual stream only impact that specific stream.  Data received on other streams can continue to be reassembled and delivered to the application.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.4">3.4.</a> <a href="#rich-signaling-for-congestion-control-and-loss-recovery" id="rich-signaling-for-congestion-control-and-loss-recovery">Rich Signaling for Congestion Control and Loss Recovery</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.4.p.1">QUIC&#8217;s packet framing and acknowledgments carry rich information that help both congestion control and loss recovery in fundamental ways.  Each QUIC packet carries a new packet number, including those carrying retransmitted data.  This obviates the need for a separate mechanism to distinguish acks for retransmissions from those for original transmissions, avoiding TCP&#8217;s retransmission ambiguity problem.  QUIC acknowledgments also explicitly encode the delay between the receipt of a packet and its acknowledgment being sent, and together with the monotonically-increasing packet numbers, this allows for precise network roundtrip-time (RTT) calculation.  QUIC&#8217;s ACK frames support up to 256 ack blocks, so QUIC is more resilient to reordering than TCP with SACK support, as well as able to keep more bytes on the wire when there is reordering or loss.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.5"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5">3.5.</a> <a href="#stream-and-connection-flow-control" id="stream-and-connection-flow-control">Stream and Connection Flow Control</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1">QUIC implements stream- and connection-level flow control, closely following HTTP/2&#8217;s flow control mechanisms.  At a high level, a QUIC receiver advertises the absolute byte offset within each stream up to which the receiver is willing to receive data.  As data is sent, received, and delivered on a particular stream, the receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames that increase the advertised offset limit for that stream, allowing the peer to send more data on that stream.  In addition to this stream-level flow control, QUIC implements connection-level flow control to limit the aggregate buffer that a QUIC receiver is willing to allocate to all streams on a connection.  Connection-level flow control works in the same way as stream-level flow control, but the bytes delivered and highest received offset are all aggregates across all streams.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.6"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6">3.6.</a> <a href="#authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload" id="authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload">Authenticated and Encrypted Header and Payload</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">TCP headers appear in plaintext on the wire and are not authenticated, causing a plethora of injection and header manipulation issues for TCP, such as receive-window manipulation and sequence-number overwriting.  While some of these are mechanisms used by middleboxes to improve TCP performance, others are active attacks.  Even &#8220;performance-enhancing&#8221; middleboxes that routinely interpose on the transport state machine end up limiting the evolvability of the transport protocol, as has been observed in the design of MPTCP and in its subsequent deployability issues.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.2">Generally, QUIC packets are always authenticated and the payload is typically fully encrypted.  The parts of the packet header which are not encrypted are still authenticated by the receiver, so as to thwart any packet injection or manipulation by third parties.  Some early handshake packets, such as the Version Negotiation packet, are not encrypted, but information sent in these unencrypted handshake packets is later verified under crypto cover.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.3">PUBLIC_RESET packets that reset a connection are currently not authenticated.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.3.7"><a href="#rfc.section.3.7">3.7.</a> <a href="#connection-migration-and-resilience-to-nat-rebinding" id="connection-migration-and-resilience-to-nat-rebinding">Connection Migration and Resilience to NAT Rebinding</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1">QUIC connections are identified by a 64-bit Connection ID, randomly generated by the client.  QUIC&#8217;s consistent connection ID allows connections to survive changes to the client&#8217;s IP and port, such as those caused by NAT rebindings or by the client changing network connectivity to a new address.  QUIC provides automatic cryptographic verification of a rebound client, since the client continues to use the same session key for encrypting and decrypting packets.  The consistent connection ID can be used to allow migration of the connection to a new server IP address as well, since the Connection ID remains consistent across changes in the client&#8217;s and the server&#8217;s network addresses.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flags:  <ul><li>0x01 = VERSION.  The semantics of this flag depends on whether the packet is sent by the server or the client.  A client MAY set this flag and include exactly one proposed version.  A server may set this flag when the client-proposed version was unsupported, and may then provide a list (0 or more) of acceptable versions as a part of version negotiation (described in <a href="#version-negotiation">Section 5.1</a>.)</li><li>0x02 = PUBLIC_RESET.  Set to indicate that the packet is a Public Reset packet.</li><li>0x04 = KEY_PHASE.  This is used by the QUIC packet protection to identify the correct packet protection keys, see <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.</li><li>0x08 = CONNECTION_ID.  Indicates the Connection ID is present in the packet.  This must be set in all packets until negotiated to a different value for a given direction.  For instance, if a client indicates that the 5-tuple fully identifies the connection at the client, the connection ID is optional in the server-to-client direction.</li><li>0x30 = PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE.  These two bits indicate the number of low-order-bytes of the packet number that are present in each packet.      <ul><li>11 indicates that 6 bytes of the packet number are present</li><li>10 indicates that 4 bytes of the packet number are present</li><li>01 indicates that 2 bytes of the packet number are present</li><li>00 indicates that 1 byte of the packet number is present</li></ul></li><li>0x40 = MULTIPATH.  This bit is reserved for multipath use.</li><li>0x80 is currently unused, and must be set to 0.</li></ul></li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">The fields in a Regular packet past the Common Header are the following:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>QUIC Version: A 32-bit opaque tag that represents the version of the QUIC protocol.  Only present in the client-to-server direction, and if the VERSION flag is set.  Version Negotiation is described in <a href="#version-negotiation">Section 5.1</a>.</li>
  <li>DISCUSS_AND_REPLACE: Diversification Nonce: A 32-byte nonce generated by the server and used only in the Server-&gt;Client direction to ensure that the server is able to generate unique keys per connection.  Specifically, when using QUIC&#8217;s 0-RTT crypto handshake, a repeated CHLO with the exact same connection ID and CHLO can lead to the same (intermediate) initial-encryption keys being derived for the connection.  A server-generated nonce disallows a client from causing the same keys to be derived for two distinct connections.  Once the connection is forward-secure, this nonce is no longer present in packets.  This nonce can be removed from the packet header if a requirement can be added for the crypto handshake to ensure key uniqueness.  The expectation is that TLS1.3 meets this requirement.  Upon working group adoption of this document, this requirement should be added to the crypto handshake requirements, and the nonce should be removed from the packet format.</li>
  <li>Packet Number: The lower 8, 16, 32, or 48 bits of the packet number, based on the PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE flag.  Each Regular packet is assigned a packet number by the sender.  The first packet sent by an endpoint MUST have a packet number of 1.</li>
  <li>AEAD Data: A Regular packet&#8217;s header, which includes the Common Header, and the Version, Diversification Nonce, and Packet Number fields, is authenticated but not encrypted.  The rest of a Regular packet, starting with the first frame, is both authenticated and encrypted.  Immediately following the header, Regular packets contain AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) data.  This data must be decrypted in order for the contents to be interpreted.  After decryption, the plaintext consists of a sequence of frames, as shown (frames are described in <a href="#frames">Section 4.3.2</a>).</li>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.1">The complete packet number is a 64-bit unsigned number and is used as part of a cryptographic nonce for packet encryption.  To reduce the number of bits required to represent the packet number over the wire, at most 48 bits of the packet number are transmitted over the wire.  A QUIC endpoint MUST NOT reuse a complete packet number within the same connection (that is, under the same cryptographic keys).  If the total number of packets transmitted in this connection reaches 2^64 - 1, the sender MUST close the connection by sending a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame with the error code QUIC_SEQUENCE_NUMBER_LIMIT_REACHED (connection termination is described in <a href="#termination">Section 5.4</a>.)  For unambiguous reconstruction of the complete packet number by a receiver from the lower-order bits, a QUIC sender MUST NOT have more than 2^(packet_number_size - 2) in flight at any point in the connection.  In other words,</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>If a sender sets PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE bits to 11, it MUST NOT have more than (2^46) packets in flight.</li>
  <li>If a sender sets PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE bits to 10, it MUST NOT have more than (2^30) packets in flight.</li>
  <li>If a sender sets PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE bits to 01, it MUST NOT have more than (2^14) packets in flight.</li>
  <li>If a sender sets PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE bits to 00, it MUST NOT have more than (2^6) packets in flight.  <br/><br/> DISCUSS: Should the receiver be required to enforce this rule that the sender MUST NOT exceed the inflight limit?  Specifically, should the receiver drop packets that are received outside this window?  <br/><br/> Any truncated packet number received from a peer MUST be reconstructed as the value closest to the next expected packet number from that peer.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">A QUIC connection is a single conversation between two QUIC endpoints.  QUIC&#8217;s connection establishment intertwines version negotiation with the crypto and transport handshakes to reduce connection establishment latency, as described in <a href="#handshake">Section 5.2</a>.  Once established, a connection may migrate to a different IP or port at either endpoint, due to NAT rebinding or mobility, as described in <a href="#migration">Section 5.3</a>.  Finally a connection may be terminated by either endpoint, as described in <a href="#termination">Section 5.4</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.1">QUIC&#8217;s connection establishment begins with version negotiation, since all communication between the endpoints, including packet and frame formats, relies on the two endpoints agreeing on a version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.2">A QUIC connection begins with a client sending a handshake packet. Until the cryptographic handshake (<a href="#handshake">Section 5.2</a>) produces 1-RTT keys, packets sent by a client MUST include the version in the packet header.  This allows the server to identify early packets and to enable version negotiation.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.3">When the server receives a packet from a client with the VERSION flag set, it compares the client&#8217;s version to the versions it supports.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.4">If the version selected by the client is not acceptable to the server, the server discards the incoming packet and responds with a version negotiation packet (<a href="#version-negotiation-packet">Section 4.4</a>).  This includes the VERSION flag and a list of versions that the server will accept.  A server MUST send a version negotiation packet for every packet that it receives with an unacceptable version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.5">If the packet contains a version that is acceptable to the server, the server proceeds with the handshake (<a href="#handshake">Section 5.2</a>).  All subsequent packets sent by the server MUST have the version flag off.  This commits the server to the version that the client selected.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.6">When the client receives a Version Negotiation packet from the server, it should select an acceptable protocol version.  If such a version is found, the client MUST resend all packets using the new version, and the resent packets MUST use new packet numbers.  These packets MUST continue to have the VERSION flag set and MUST include the new negotiated protocol version.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.p.7">The client MUST include its selected version on all packets until it starts protecting packets with 1-RTT keys.  Only unprotected packets and 0-RTT protected packets can include a version.  A client MUST NOT change the version it uses unless it is in response to a version negotiation packet from the server.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.p.1">QUIC&#8217;s current crypto handshake mechanism is documented in <a href="#QUICCrypto">[QUICCrypto]</a>.  QUIC does not restrict itself to using a specific handshake protocol, so the details of a specific handshake protocol are out of this document&#8217;s scope.  If not explicitly specified in the application mapping, TLS is assumed to be the default crypto handshake protocol, as described in <a href="#QUIC-TLS">[QUIC-TLS]</a>.

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.p.2">The following list of requirements and recommendations documents properties of the current prototype handshake which should be provided by any handshake protocol.</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The crypto handshake MUST ensure that the final negotiated key is distinct for every connection between two endpoints.</li>
  <li>Transport Negotiation: The crypto handshake MUST provide a mechanism for the transport component to exchange transport parameters and Source Address Tokens.  To avoid downgrade attacks, the transport parameters sent and received MUST be verified before the handshake completes successfully.</li>
  <li>Connection Establishment in 0-RTT: Since low-latency connection establishment is a critical feature of QUIC, the QUIC handshake protocol SHOULD attempt to achieve 0-RTT connection establishment latency for repeated connections between the same endpoints.</li>
  <li>Source Address Spoofing Defense: Since QUIC handles source address verification, the crypto protocol SHOULD NOT impose a separate source address verification mechanism.</li>
  <li>Server Config Update: A QUIC server may refresh the source-address token (STK) mid-connection, to update the information stored in the STK at the client and to extend the period over which 0-RTT connections can be established by the client.</li>
  <li>Certificate Compression: Early QUIC experience demonstrated that compressing certificates exchanged during a handshake is valuable in reducing latency.  This additionally helps to reduce the amplification attack footprint when a server sends a large set of certificates, which is not uncommon with TLS.  The crypto protocol SHOULD compress certificates and any other information to minimize the number of packets sent during a handshake.</li>

QUIC&#8217;s consistent connection ID allows connections to survive changes to the client&#8217;s IP and/or port, such as those caused by client or server migrating to a new network.

<p id="rfc.section.5.4.p.1">Connections should remain open until they become idle for a pre-negotiated period of time.  A QUIC connection, once established, can be terminated in one of three ways:</p>
<p/>

<ol>
  <li>Explicit Shutdown: An endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame to the peer initiating a connection termination.  An endpoint may send a GOAWAY frame to the peer prior to a CONNECTION_CLOSE to indicate that the connection will soon be terminated.  A GOAWAY frame signals to the peer that any active streams will continue to be processed, but the sender of the GOAWAY will not initiate any additional streams and will not accept any new incoming streams.  On termination of the active streams, a CONNECTION_CLOSE may be sent.  If an endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame while unterminated streams are active (no FIN bit or RST_STREAM frames have been sent or received for one or more streams), then the peer must assume that the streams were incomplete and were abnormally terminated.</li>
  <li>Implicit Shutdown: The default idle timeout for a QUIC connection is 30 seconds, and is a required parameter (ICSL) in connection negotiation.  The maximum is 10 minutes.  If there is no network activity for the duration of the idle timeout, the connection is closed.  By default a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame will be sent.  A silent close option can be enabled when it is expensive to send an explicit close, such as mobile networks that must wake up the radio.</li>
  <li>Abrupt Shutdown: An endpoint may send a Public Reset packet at any time during the connection to abruptly terminate an active connection.  A Public Reset packet SHOULD only be used as a final recourse.  Commonly, a public reset is expected to be sent when a packet on an established connection is received by an endpoint that is unable decrypt the packet.  For instance, if a server reboots mid-connection and loses any cryptographic state associated with open connections, and then receives a packet on an open connection, it should send a Public Reset packet in return.  (TODO: articulate rules around when a public reset should be sent.)</li>

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.2">To limit the ACK blocks to the ones that haven&#8217;t yet been received by the sender, the sender periodically sends STOP_WAITING frames that signal the receiver to stop acking packets below a specified sequence number, raising the &#8220;least unacked&#8221; packet number at the receiver.  A sender of an ACK frame thus reports only those ACK blocks between the received least unacked and the reported largest observed packet numbers.

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">The maximum packet size for QUIC is the maximum size of the encrypted payload of the resulting UDP datagram.  All QUIC packets SHOULD be sized to fit within the path&#8217;s MTU to avoid IP fragmentation.  The recommended default maximum packet size is 1350 bytes for IPv6 and 1370 bytes for IPv4.  To optimize better, endpoints MAY use PLPMTUD <a href="#RFC4821">[RFC4821]</a> for detecting the path&#8217;s MTU and setting the maximum packet size appropriately.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">A sender bundles one or more frames in a Regular QUIC packet.  A sender MAY bundle any set of frames in a packet.  All QUIC packets MUST contain a packet number and MAY contain one or more frames (<a href="#frames">Section 4.3.2</a>).  Packet numbers MUST be unique within a connection and MUST NOT be reused within the same connection.  Packet numbers MUST be assigned to packets in a strictly monotonically increasing order.  The initial packet number used, at both the client and the server, MUST be 0.  That is, the first packet in both directions of the connection MUST have a packet number of 0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">A sender SHOULD minimize per-packet bandwidth and computational costs by bundling as many frames as possible within a QUIC packet.  A sender MAY wait for a short period of time to bundle multiple frames before sending a packet that is not maximally packed, to avoid sending out large numbers of small packets.  An implementation may use heuristics about expected application sending behavior to determine whether and for how long to wait.  This waiting period is an implementation decision, and an implementation should be careful to delay conservatively, since any delay is likely to increase application-visible latency.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Regular QUIC packets are &#8220;containers&#8221; of frames; a packet is never retransmitted whole, but frames in a lost packet may be rebundled and transmitted in a subsequent packet as necessary.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.5">A packet may contain frames and/or application data, only some of which may require reliability.  When a packet is detected as lost, the sender re-sends any frames as necessary:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>All application data sent in STREAM frames MUST be retransmitted, with one exception.  When an endpoint sends a RST_STREAM frame, data outstanding on that stream SHOULD NOT be retransmitted, since subsequent data on this stream is expected to not be delivered by the receiver.</li>
  <li>ACK, STOP_WAITING, and PADDING frames MUST NOT be retransmitted.  New frames of these types may however be bundled with any outgoing packet.</li>
  <li>All other frames MUST be retransmitted.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.7.p.8">A receiver acknowledges receipt of a received packet by sending one or more ACK frames containing the packet number of the received packet.  To avoid perpetual acking between endpoints, a receiver MUST NOT generate an ack in response to every packet containing only ACK frames.  However, since it is possible that an endpoint sends only packets containing ACK frame (or other non-retransmittable frames), the receiving peer MAY send an ACK frame after a reasonable number (currently 20) of such packets have been received.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">Streams in QUIC provide a lightweight, ordered, and bidirectional byte-stream abstraction.  Streams can be created either by the client or the server, can concurrently send data interleaved with other streams, and can be cancelled.  QUIC&#8217;s stream lifetime is modeled closely after HTTP/2&#8217;s <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a>.  Streams are independent of each other in delivery order.  That is, data that is received on a stream is delivered in order within that stream, but there is no particular delivery order across streams.  Transmit ordering among streams is left to the implementation.  QUIC streams are considered lightweight in that the creation and destruction of streams are expected to have minimal bandwidth and computational cost.  A single STREAM frame may create, carry data for, and terminate a stream, or a stream may last the entire duration of a connection.  Implementations are therefore advised to keep these extremes in mind and to implement stream creation and destruction to be as lightweight as possible.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">An alternative view of QUIC streams is as an elastic &#8220;message&#8221; abstraction, similar to the way ephemeral streams are used in SST <a href="#SST">[SST]</a>, which may be a more appealing description for some applications.</p>

An endpoint that receives a STREAM frame that causes its advertised concurrent stream limit to be exceeded MUST treat this as a stream error of type QUIC_TOO_MANY_OPEN_STREAMS (<a href="#error-handling">Section 10</a>).</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.8.4"><a href="#rfc.section.8.4">8.4.</a> <a href="#sending-and-receiving-data" id="sending-and-receiving-data">Sending and Receiving Data</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.1">Once a stream is created, endpoints may use the stream to send and receive data.  Each endpoint may send a series of STREAM frames encapsulating data on a stream until the stream is terminated in that direction.  Streams are an ordered byte-stream abstraction, and they have no other structure within them.  STREAM frame boundaries are not expected to be preserved in retransmissions from the sender or during delivery to the application at the receiver.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.2">When new data is to be sent on a stream, a sender MUST set the encapsulating STREAM frame&#8217;s offset field to the stream offset of the first byte of this new data.  The first byte of data that is sent on a stream has the stream offset 0.  A receiver MUST ensure that received stream data is delivered to the application as an ordered byte-stream.  Data received out of order MUST be buffered for later delivery, as long as it is not in violation of the receiver&#8217;s flow control limits.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.3">An endpoint MUST NOT send any stream data without consulting the congestion controller and the flow controller, with the following two exceptions.</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The crypto handshake stream, Stream 1, MUST NOT be subject to congestion control or connection-level flow control, but MUST be subject to stream-level flow control.</li>
  <li>An application MAY exclude specific stream IDs from connection-level flow control.  If so, these streams MUST NOT be subject to connection-level flow control.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.8.4.p.5">Flow control is described in detail in <a href="#flow-control">Section 9</a>, and congestion control is described in the companion document <a href="#QUIC-RECOVERY">[QUIC-RECOVERY]</a>.</p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.9"><a href="#rfc.section.9">9.</a> <a href="#flow-control" id="flow-control">Flow Control</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">It is necessary to limit the amount of data that a sender may have outstanding at any time, so as to prevent a fast sender from overwhelming a slow receiver, or to prevent a malicious sender from consuming significant resources at a receiver.  This section describes QUIC&#8217;s flow-control mechanisms.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">QUIC employs a credit-based flow-control scheme similar to HTTP/2&#8217;s flow control <a href="#RFC7540">[RFC7540]</a>.  A receiver advertises the number of octets it is prepared to receive on a given stream and for the entire connection.  This leads to two levels of flow control in QUIC: (i) Connection flow control, which prevents senders from exceeding a receiver&#8217;s buffer capacity for the connection, and (ii) Stream flow control, which prevents a single stream from consuming the entire receive buffer for a connection.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.3">A receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames to the sender to advertise additional credit, for both connection and stream flow control.  A receiver advertises the maximum absolute byte offset in the stream or in the connection which the receiver is willing to receive.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.4">The initial flow control credit is 65536 bytes for both the stream and connection flow controllers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.5">A receiver MAY advertise a larger offset at any point in the connection by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame.  A receiver MUST NOT renege on an advertisement; that is, once a receiver advertises an offset via a WINDOW_UPDATE frame, it MUST NOT subsequently advertise a smaller offset.  A sender may receive WINDOW_UPDATE frames out of order; a sender MUST therefore ignore any reductions in flow control credit.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.6">A sender MUST send BLOCKED frames to indicate it has data to write but is blocked by lack of connection or stream flow control credit.  BLOCKED frames are expected to be sent infrequently in common cases, but they are considered useful for debugging and monitoring purposes.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.7">A receiver advertises credit for a stream by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with the StreamID set appropriately.  A receiver may simply use the current received offset to determine the flow control offset to be advertised.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.8">Connection flow control is a limit to the total bytes of stream data sent in STREAM frames.  A receiver advertises credit for a connection by sending a WINDOW_UPDATE frame with the StreamID set to zero (0x00).  A receiver may maintain a cumulative sum of bytes received cumulatively on all streams to determine the value of the connection flow control offset to be advertised in WINDOW_UPDATE frames.  A sender may maintain a cumulative sum of stream data bytes sent to impose the connection flow control limit.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.9.1"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1">9.1.</a> <a href="#edge-cases-and-other-considerations" id="edge-cases-and-other-considerations">Edge Cases and Other Considerations</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.p.1">There are some edge cases which must be considered when dealing with stream and connection level flow control.  Given enough time, both endpoints must agree on flow control state.  If one end believes it can send more than the other end is willing to receive, the connection will be torn down when too much data arrives.  Conversely if a sender believes it is blocked, while endpoint B expects more data can be received, then the connection can be in a deadlock, with the sender waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE which will never come.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.1">9.1.1.</a> <a href="#mid-stream-rststream" id="mid-stream-rststream">Mid-stream RST_STREAM</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.1">On receipt of an RST_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state for the matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that stream.  This could result in the endpoints getting out of sync, since the RST_STREAM frame may have arrived out of order and there may be further bytes in flight.  The data sender would have counted the data against its connection level flow control budget, but a receiver that has not received these bytes would not know to include them as well.  The receiver must learn of the number of bytes that were sent on the stream to make the same adjustment in its connection flow controller.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.2">To avoid this de-synchronization, a RST_STREAM sender MUST include the final byte offset sent on the stream in the RST_STREAM frame.  On receiving a RST_STREAM frame, a receiver definitively knows how many bytes were sent on that stream before the RST_STREAM frame, and the receiver MUST use the final offset to account for all bytes sent on the stream in its connection level flow controller.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.2">9.1.2.</a> <a href="#response-to-a-rststream" id="response-to-a-rststream">Response to a RST_STREAM</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.2.p.1">Since streams are bidirectional, a sender of a RST_STREAM needs to know how many bytes the peer has sent on the stream.  If an endpoint receives a RST_STREAM frame and has sent neither a FIN nor a RST_STREAM, it MUST send a RST_STREAM in response, bearing the offset of the last byte sent on this stream as the final offset.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.3">9.1.3.</a> <a href="#offset-increment" id="offset-increment">Offset Increment</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.1">This document leaves when and how many bytes to advertise in a WINDOW_UPDATE to the implementation, but offers a few considerations.  WINDOW_UPDATE frames constitute overhead, and therefore, sending a WINDOW_UPDATE with small offset increments is undesirable.  At the same time, sending WINDOW_UPDATES with large offset increments requires the sender to commit to that amount of buffer.  Implementations must find the correct tradeoff between these sides to determine how large an offset increment to send in a WINDOW_UPDATE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.3.p.2">A receiver MAY use an autotuning mechanism to tune the size of the offset increment to advertise based on a roundtrip time estimate and the rate at which the receiving application consumes data, similar to common TCP implementations.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.9.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.4">9.1.4.</a> <a href="#blocked-frames" id="blocked-frames">BLOCKED frames</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.9.1.4.p.1">If a sender does not receive a WINDOW_UPDATE frame when it has run out of flow control credit, the sender will be blocked and MUST send a BLOCKED frame.  A BLOCKED frame is expected to be useful for debugging at the receiver.  A receiver SHOULD NOT wait for a BLOCKED frame before sending with a WINDOW_UPDATE, since doing so will cause at least one roundtrip of quiescence.  For smooth operation of the congestion controller, it is generally considered best to not let the sender go into quiescence if avoidable.  To avoid blocking a sender, and to reasonably account for the possibiity of loss, a receiver should send a WINDOW_UPDATE frame at least two roundtrips before it expects the sender to get blocked.</p>

<h2 id="rfc.section.11.1"><a href="#rfc.section.11.1">11.1.</a> <a href="#spoofed-ack-attack" id="spoofed-ack-attack">Spoofed Ack Attack</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.1">An attacker receives an STK from the server and then releases the IP address on which it received the STK.  The attacker may, in the future, spoof this same address (which now presumably addresses a different endpoint), and initiate a 0-RTT connection with a server on the victim&#8217;s behalf.  The attacker then spoofs ACK frames to the server which cause the server to potentially drown the victim in data.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.2">There are two possible mitigations to this attack.  The simplest one is that a server can unilaterally create a gap in packet-number space.  In the non-attack scenario, the client will send an ack with a larger largest acked.  In the attack scenario, the attacker may ack a packet in the gap.  If the server sees an ack for a packet that was never sent, the connection can be aborted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.11.1.p.3">The second mitigation is that the server can require that acks for sent packets match the encryption level of the sent packet.  This mitigation is useful if the connection has an ephemeral forward-secure key that is generated and used for every new connection.  If a packet sent is encrypted with a forward-secure key, then any acks that are received for them must also be forward-secure encrypted.  Since the attacker will not have the forward secure key, the attacker will not be able to generate forward-secure encrypted ack packets.</p>
