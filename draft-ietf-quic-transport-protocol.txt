           QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport
               draft-ietf-quic-transport-protocol-latest

Abstract

   QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top
   of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience, and implements
   mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport
   protocol.  Using UDP as the basis of QUIC is intended to address
   compatibility issues with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC
   authenticates all of its headers, preventing third parties from from
   changing them.  QUIC encrypts most of its headers, thereby limiting
   protocol evolution to QUIC endpoints only.  Therefore, middleboxes,
   in large part, are not required to be updated as new protocol
   versions are deployed.  This document describes the core QUIC
   protocol, including the conceptual design, wire format, and
   mechanisms of the QUIC protocol for connection establishment, stream
   multiplexing, stream and connection-level flow control, and data
   reliability.  Accompanying documents describe QUIC's loss recovery
   and congestion control, and the use of TLS 1.3 for key negotiation.

1.  Introduction

   QUIC is a multiplexed and secure transport protocol that runs on top
   of UDP.  QUIC builds on past transport experience and implements
   mechanisms that make it useful as a modern general-purpose transport
   protocol.  Using UDP as the substrate, QUIC seeks to be compatible
   with legacy clients and middleboxes.  QUIC authenticates all of its
   headers, preventing middleboxes and other third parties from changing
   them, and encrypts most of its headers, limiting protocol evolution
   largely to QUIC endpoints only.

   This document describes the core QUIC protocol, including the
   conceptual design, wire format, and mechanisms of the QUIC protocol
   for connection establishment, stream multiplexing, stream and
   connection-level flow control, and data reliability.  Accompanying
   documents describe QUIC's loss detection and congestion control
   [I-D.iyengar-quic-loss-recovery], and the use of TLS 1.3 for key
   negotiation [I-D.thomson-quic-tls].

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" are used in this
   document.  It's not shouting; when they are capitalized, they have
   the special meaning defined in [RFC2119].
