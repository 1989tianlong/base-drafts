QUIC provides a dedicated stream (Stream ID 1) to be used for performing the crypto handshake and QUIC options negotiation.

When an application multiplexes many streams atop TCP’s single-bytestream abstraction, a loss of a TCP segment results in blocking of all subsequent segments until a retransmission arrives, irrespective of the application streams that are encapsulated in subsequent segments.

Each QUIC packet carries a new packet number, including those carrying retransmitted data. This obviates the need for a separate mechanism to distinguish acks for retransmissions from those for original transmissions, avoiding TCP’s retransmission ambiguity problem. QUIC acknowledgments also explicitly encode the delay between the receipt of a packet and its acknowledgment being sent, and together with the monotonically-increasing packet numbers, this allows for precise network roundtrip-time (RTT) calculation. QUIC’s ACK frames support up to 256 ack blocks, so QUIC is more resilient to reordering than TCP with SACK support, as well as able to keep more bytes on the wire when there is reordering or loss.</p></div></section><section id="stream-and-connection-flow-control"><h3 id="rfc.section.3.5"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5">3.5</a> <a href="#stream-and-connection-flow-control">Stream and Connection Flow Control</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.3.5.p.1"><p>QUIC implements stream- and connection-level flow control, closely following HTTP/2’s flow control mechanisms. At a high level, a QUIC receiver advertises the absolute byte offset within each stream up to which the receiver is willing to receive data. As data is sent, received, and delivered on a particular stream, the receiver sends WINDOW_UPDATE frames that increase the advertised offset limit for that stream, allowing the peer to send more data on that stream. In addition to this stream-level flow control, QUIC implements connection-level flow control to limit the aggregate buffer that a QUIC receiver is willing to allocate to all streams on a connection. Connection-level flow control works in the same way as stream-level flow control, but the bytes delivered and highest received offset are all aggregates across all streams.</p></div></section><section id="authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload"><h3 id="rfc.section.3.6"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6">3.6</a> <a href="#authenticated-and-encrypted-header-and-payload">Authenticated and Encrypted Header and Payload</a></h3><div id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1"><p>TCP headers appear in plaintext on the wire and are not authenticated, causing a plethora of injection and header manipulation issues for TCP, such as receive-window manipulation and sequence-number overwriting.

QUIC provides automatic cryptographic verification of a rebound client, since the client continues to use the same session key for encrypting and decrypting packets.

Specifically, when using QUIC’s 0-RTT crypto handshake, a repeated CHLO with the exact same connection ID and CHLO can lead to the same (intermediate) initial-encryption keys being derived for the connection. A server-generated nonce disallows a client from causing the same keys to be derived for two distinct connections. Once the connection is forward-secure, this nonce is no longer present in packets. This nonce can be removed from the packet header if a requirement can be added for the crypto handshake to ensure key uniqueness. The expectation is that TLS1.3 meets this requirement. Upon working group adoption of this document, this requirement should be added to the crypto handshake requirements, and the nonce should be removed from the packet format.</li><li>Packet Number: The lower 8, 16, 32, or 48 bits of the packet number, based on the PACKET_NUMBER_SIZE flag.

On termination of the active streams, a CONNECTION_CLOSE may be sent. If an endpoint sends a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame while unterminated streams are active (no FIN bit or RST_STREAM frames have been sent or received for one or more streams), then the peer must assume that the streams were incomplete and were abnormally terminated.</li><li>Implicit Shutdown: The default idle timeout for a QUIC connection is 30 seconds, and is a required parameter (ICSL) in connection negotiation.

QUIC’s stream lifetime is modeled closely after HTTP/2’s <a href="#RFC7540"><cite title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol Version 2 (HTTP/2)">[RFC7540]</cite></a>. Streams are independent of each other in delivery order. That is, data that is received on a stream is delivered in order within that stream, but there is no particular delivery order across streams. Transmit ordering among streams is left to the implementation. QUIC streams are considered lightweight in that the creation and destruction of streams are expected to have minimal bandwidth and computational cost. A single STREAM frame may create, carry data for, and terminate a stream, or a stream may last the entire duration of a connection.

Conversely if a sender believes it is blocked, while endpoint B expects more data can be received, then the connection can be in a deadlock, with the sender waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE which will never come.</p></div><section id="mid-stream-rststream"><h4 id="rfc.section.9.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.9.1.1">9.1.1</a> <a href="#mid-stream-rststream">Mid-stream RST_STREAM</a></h4><div id="rfc.section.9.1.1.p.1"><p>On receipt of an RST_STREAM frame, an endpoint will tear down state for the matching stream and ignore further data arriving on that stream.

WINDOW_UPDATE frames constitute overhead, and therefore, sending a WINDOW_UPDATE with small offset increments is undesirable.

A BLOCKED frame is expected to be useful for debugging at the receiver. A receiver SHOULD NOT wait for a BLOCKED frame before sending with a WINDOW_UPDATE, since doing so will cause at least one roundtrip of quiescence. For smooth operation of the congestion controller, it is generally considered best to not let the sender go into quiescence if avoidable. To avoid blocking a sender, and to reasonably account for the possibiity of loss, a receiver should send a WINDOW_UPDATE frame at least two roundtrips before it expects the sender to get blocked.</p></div></section></section></section><hr class="noprint"><section id="error-codes"><h2 id="rfc.section.10" class="np"><a href="#rfc.section.10">10.</a> <a href="#error-codes">Error Codes</a></h2><div id="rfc.section.10.p.1"><p>This section lists all the QUIC error codes that may be used in a CONNECTION_CLOSE frame.

The attacked may in the future, spoof this same address (which now presumably addresses a different endpoint), and initiates a 0-RTT connection with a server on the victim’s behalf. The attacker then spoofs ack packets to the server which cause the server to potentially drown the victim in data.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.11.1.p.2"><p>There are two possible mitigations to this attack. The simplest one is that a server can unilaterally create a gap in packet-number space. In the non-attack scenario, the client will send an ack with a larger largest acked. In the attack scenario, the attacker may ack a packet in the gap. If the server sees an ack for a packet that was never sent, the connection can be aborted.</p></div><div id="rfc.section.11.1.p.3"><p>The second mitigation is that the server can require that acks for sent packets match the encryption level of the sent packet. This mitigation is useful if the connection has an ephemeral forward- secure key that is generated and used for every new connection. If a packet sent is encrypted with a forward-secure key, then any acks that are received for them must also be forward-secure encrypted. Since the attacker will not have the forward secure key, the attacker will not be able to generate forward-secure encrypted ack packets.</p></div></section></section><hr class="noprint"><section id="contributors"><h2 id="rfc.section.12" class="np"><a href="#rfc.section.12">12.</a> <a href="#contributors">Contributors</a></h2><div id="rfc.section.12.p.1"><p>The pre-IETF design of QUIC, described in <a href="#I-D.hamilton-quic-transport-protocol"><cite title="QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport">[I-D.hamilton-quic-transport-protocol]</cite></a>, laid the foundations of the protocol described in this document.
